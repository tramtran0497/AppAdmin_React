# AppAdmin_React 
A project which is written by React with many supported libraries. Learning from youtuber: Lama Dev.

**However, it is in underprocessing as well as I have not finished all functions.**

## What the application is created for?
This is the Admin Project, it means a web page which has created and used for the management, summary and statics of the Sales in a period time. Esily giving a report or a generalmoverview of the company's business.

Web page is the Admin App of the E-commerce Project (in Github).

## Many supported libraries and others:
#### Material UI including icons, data-grid:
Making good-looking project by using icons of Material UI, besides, it is easily for developer to use as a component and readable code.
#### React-Router-Dom
React Router DOM enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app, this led to build the project easier and simple. 
#### Recharts
Recharts library is useful in my project, the Admin project as the above concept (summary and general overview) the library helps me to create some charts easier through some conponents and props. 

## Toughs during process
- Having much interesting things in Material UI and Recharts, however I should practise them more through reading the document.

- In lessons of Lama Dev, he made video for 2 years ago with React-Router_Dom old version. Therefore, I had a little bit difficulties during looking for how to use the React-Router_Dom with new version. My solution is found in some blogs and `Stackoverflow` comunity as well as, of course, the document.

- More toughs later... (After I finish my own project, I need more time to learn more...)
